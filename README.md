# MAVIS

MAVIS is a virtual sidekick that can take care of anything you want, as long as it has a Skill for it. MAVIS serves as an integration hub to numerous communications platforms (such as Bot Framework platforms, Alexa, Facebook, Slack, etc), enabling developers to create custom Skills that are cross-platform.

This project was created for the purpose of education and experimentation with various technologies.
